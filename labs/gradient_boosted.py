# parameters

# n_estimators: unlike with Random forests, more isn't always better, because too high leads to overfitting
# So we want to use cross validation to find the right n.

n_est_list = 

# learning_rate: how much to weight subsequent trees



# loss: type of loss function. we usuaulyl use exponential loss (AdaBoost algorithm)

# rest of paramemters are shared with decision trees.
